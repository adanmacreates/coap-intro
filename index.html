    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm an Interactive Digital Media senior at the Webster Groves campus. I do a mix of graphic design and web
      development. I'm looking to get better at working with clients to creative websites for them, and learn new tools
      like Dreamweaver for work.</p>
      <h2>Favorite Book</h2>
    <p>I'll be honest, I don't read for pleasure much anymore on top of work, school and Netflix. But one of my favorite
      books is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love science fiction, and the book was easy to get lost in while
      reading. I was able to create a whole world and really connect with the characters</p>
